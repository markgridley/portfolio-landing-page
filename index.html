            <p>I was inspired to pursue the world of programming after seeing the success of two colleagues who have graduated from Epicodus. Portland is a great city with a lot of tech industry opportunities, and I'm excited to challenge myself by learning something new. I have previously worked for these companies in non-tech related positions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Apple</li>
              <li>Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have an <span class="edu">Associate of Science</span> degree in Psychology from <span class="edu">Portland Community College</span>.</p>

            <p>Though I currently have little history with programming, I have a lot of other interests. For example, I love to travel and see the outside world. My upbringing in a military family may have something to do with that. When I'm not fantasizing about seeing the world, you can find me reading a sad book, playing a lighthearted video game, or kissing a cute dog!</p>
            <p>Here are three rules I live by:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>If it <em>can</em> be funny, it <em>should</em> be funny.</li>
                <li>Sad stories make the best stories.</li>
                <li>Animal Crossing is the <strong>BEST!</strong> gaming franchise of all time.</li>
              </ol>
