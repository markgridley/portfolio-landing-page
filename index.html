            <p>I was inspired to pursue the world of programming after seeing the success of two colleagues who have graduated from Epicodus. Portland is a great city with a lot of tech industry opportunities, and I'm excited to challenge myself by learning something new. I have previously worked for these companies in non-tech related positions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Apple</li>
              <li>Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have an Associate of Science degree in Psychology from Portland Community College.</p>
